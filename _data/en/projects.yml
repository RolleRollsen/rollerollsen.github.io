- title: 4D Flow Field Measurement of Settling Spheres in Newtonian Fluids
  description: Experimental study using 3D particle tracking velocimetry for time-resolved flow field reconstruction to investigate the trajectories and flow dynamics of spheres settling in viscous Newtonian fluids at low Reynolds numbers (Re 1.6–6). The research reveals oscillatory motion patterns and links those to pressure fluctuations on the spheres surface by using *proper orthogonal decomposition* (POD). 
  detailed_description: |
    This study employed advanced experimental techniques to capture both sphere motion and surrounding flow fields simultaneously. The flow field was captured using 3D particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV) with the Shake-the-Box (STB) algorithm. Discrete tracer particle tracks were converted to an Eulerian grid via fine-scale reconstruction using the advanced vortex-in-cell method (VIC#), which additionally provided local pressure field information by solving the Pressure-Poisson equation.
    

    **POD Analysis (My Contribution):**

    The *proper orthogonal decomposition* (POD) was applied to examine coherent structures in the unsteady flow, specifically calculated for the pressure field on the sphere's surface. Pressure was chosen for the POD because fluctuations in the trajectory of the sphere are induced by pressure differences in close proximity to the sphere.

    The power spectral density analysis of the temporal coefficients revealed four distinct regimes across the first 32 modes, with characteristic Strouhal numbers correlating to those found in the sphere trajectories.

    Characteristic modes were extracted, and the frequencies of these modes aligned well with oscillation frequencies found in the trajectories, suggesting that trajectory instabilities can be partly attributed to pressure fluctuations on the sphere surface. The spatial visualization of the modes provides intuitive understanding of which mode contributes to which oscillation.
